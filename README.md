# NWEA
Code sample work

I decided to implement a two player game first and then refactor the code to include more players. I've spent just a few hours on this in its current state. I have created a jasmine file but its not fleshed out. IF given two to three more hours I can flesh this out with multiple players and a completed unit test.
